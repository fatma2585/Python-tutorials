Q1) Calculate the Luminosity for the matched table with Chandra X-rays mission, 
Plot between Luminosity and redshift, 
Comment on the graph (the evolution of quasars luminosity)

Hint: Not all fluxes have the same unit check your table flux unit metadata, and check their conversion on the Astropy website.   

Q2/ Save your fits table with (Name, RA, DEC, Z, L)
